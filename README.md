# WITcCS
### Name
WITcCS - Wireless Information Transfer on a calculator Chat Software

### Description:
WITc (Pronounced Wit C) is a project produced by Joshua Schumacher. That allows for wireless information transfer on a calculator (more specifically a TI-84 Plus CE)

## What Inspired The Project
WITc is a project that I was inspired to make after seeing this [post](https://hackaday.com/2014/04/27/send-wireless-txt-between-two-ti-calculators/). After I saw it I thought to myself “How could I improve this?”. And I then set out to start working on a project that was later named “WITc”. But first I must start from the beginning, I first started (like all of my other projects) by making a word [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AWiZhMXZsK3D3-d6IyBq7924qI4JlDx5Ulawh1ugFTg/edit?usp=sharing) and labeling everything I would be doing then progressing on to doing research, and then started to work on the project. I first started working with the [software](https://github.com/JSSchumacher/WITcCS), because I wanted to make sure that the main part of the project that would carry it was still possible which turned out to be {Not Tested Yet}. (you may be wondering why it says “not testing yet” well let me tell you. It is because of the stupid calculator that I am making the project with costs inbetween $80-$100 and I don't much feel like spending that to see if my software works. But what I can do is wait until school starts back and borrow one of my friend's calculator because yes I am still in school [yay, 11th grade! -_-].) Now, this will be updated as I work on this but for right now I am only saying such and nothing about the hardware because I don't much care for someone trying to steal my idea. (plus my software is already under a license so you can't take that without me knowing and if you do then I can shut you down [yay, legal crap!])


# Currently Supported:
- TI-84 Plus CE (TI-BASIC Edition)
- TI-84 Plus CE-T (TI-BASIC Edition)

## Planned:
- TI-84 Plus
- TI-84 Plus Silver Edition

## Not Planned:
- TI-84 Plus CE (Python Edition)
- TI-84 Plus CE-T (Python Edition)
(For the Python Calculators, it is because I don't have one to work on or test nor would I know how to make them talk to each other [BASIC To Python or Python To Python])
